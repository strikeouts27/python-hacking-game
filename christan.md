57 render words pulls the render word function

standard loop and range rows . it runs the 

every single loop within the loop will generate one row of text. 
scalability super early on. 

for loop in range(rows)


num = random.randint() generates random number in teh range and it gets stored in mem.

fake memory address  is made at 0x4481-> fake memor address 

def render_words()
i made for loop for rows now I need a for loop to make columns.
two nested for loops can make two dimensional or two loops to make it scalable. 

end="" just makes it so that it will not space to a new line.
by default print will create a new line. two print statements are always going to end up below the other one. but if you do end="" will continue on to the next line. 

junk_string()

render words is basically setting the ground work to generate the corrupted address. 
setting up the framework for the address. 
junk_string is css and the other is html in a way. 

if this random generated variable from 0-20 
word_chance == 

the second condition if the number of the caharacters in the word does not extend 16 characters than print the word. if not than don't print it. 
n is the number they are on. 

the for loop in u in range(16) finds out how to get the junk characters. 
length of word choice and the character it is on. 16 - n 

print(junk[char_end]) line

this is grabbing a junk item from the junk list and than printing out another string to contactate. it ionly fills out to the remaining spaces in the 16 totlal character address. 

 it to the existing word that is selected. 

 Foundation level. 


pulling out the generated correct words into a set. a set cannot be duplicated. 
out of all the possible words they could guess it guesses one of them. 

Hint: 2 shows two digits. 

Duplicate letters are a problem that you solved by putting them into a set. 

it cannot have duplicated objects. there can only one of a particular objects. 
nothing consecutive in sets. they cannot have ee. they all have unique items. 

Hint is a filter for characters hints. if you said pick e. and there is a double ee, the set will only catch one e as a hint. 

two for loops are used to compare each letter one at at the time. 

compares the first letter of guess to every single letter of the 

for every letter in guess cor each character in range of password 

every password letter is compared to every guess letter and than they are stored in a set. 

guess letter is on the top of the for loop. 

the for loop will move on to the next letter.

if guess in password print true or something.
