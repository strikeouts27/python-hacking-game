# you can access items returned from a python function via return. 
# you can store containers of information and than access those items inside the container by storing them as variables. 

# making a function for a print statement is not smart. store the value inside the function variable first.

# DRY -> if I am doing a lot of copying and pasting and making minor changes, that means that I need to stop and find a way to combine operations. in this programs case I needed to use for loops to iterate over the matching letters functions. 


I am trying to create a game where the player tries to pick the correct word which is the password. The other 14 letters are incorrect options for the player. 

I have deleted a lot of lines of code because I was repeating myself. 

Python is saying the number of matches is not correct.

Can someone look at my code and give me some advice?
